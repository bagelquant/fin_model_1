Dear Professor Wu,

I hope this message finds you well.

Our group has been working on constructing a mean-variance optimized portfolio that emulates the style of the DJIA index. We utilized the Fama-French five-factor model, along with momentum, to assess the factor exposure of each stock in comparison to the DJIA index. Our mean-variance optimization was conducted under the following constraints:
1. Equivalent market (mktrf) exposure to the DJIA index.
2. Greater than or equal exposure to the SMB, HML, RMW, CMA, and UMD factors compared to the DJIA index.
3. Positive weights for all stocks (no short selling).
4. A maximum weight of 10% for each stock.

For a detailed methodology and the analysis steps, please refer to the attached methodology.pdf file.

Interestingly, the style of our optimized portfolio closely aligns with that of the DJIA index. The only exception is that the CMA factor exposure is higher than that of the DJIA index, while all other factor exposures remain consistent. Notably, our optimized portfolio achieved a Sharpe ratio of 1.24 from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2023 (the latest data available through WRDS), compared to a Sharpe ratio of 0.94 from December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2023.
